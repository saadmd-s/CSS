        <div>Hey, I'm Saad — a student who’s passionate about programming and gaming. I love turning ideas into real projects, and right now I'm working on something cool that I can’t wait to share. Coding isn’t just a skill for me — it’s a way to create, solve problems, and have fun while doing it. When I’m not working on a project, you’ll probably find me gaming, exploring new worlds, or just leveling up my skills one line of code at a time.
